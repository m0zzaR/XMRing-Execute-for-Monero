# XMRing-Execute-for-Monero

This is a very very very basic C++ program using Windows API.
All this does is allow me to have a .exe file that runs the XMRing Monero Miner for my personal computer. 
It just opens CMD and runs the correct commands so that I do not have to manually input them every time I want to mine.
